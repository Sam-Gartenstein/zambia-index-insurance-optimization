# Zambia Weather Index Insurance Optimization

The goal of this project is to reduce basis risk in weather index insurance contracts, building upon [earlier work](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/zambia-drought-analysis) where we introduced the Payout Balance Index (PBI). In this analysis, we extend that approach by applying **K-means clustering** to rainfall data, calculating the PBI at Zambia’s two administrative levels (provinces and districts), and incorporating camp-level zones created by *(add name)*. We also estimate the monetary value of **forgone insurance payouts** resulting from mismatches between payouts and observed rainfall conditions.

The forgone payout is calculated as:

$$
\text{Forgone Payout} =
(\text{Payout Value}) \times (1 - \text{PBI}) \times (\text{Number of Pixels Per Zone})
$$

### Marginal Benefit per Zone Change

After computing forgone payments, we evaluate the **marginal benefit** of increasing the number of zones. Specifically, the marginal effect of moving from zone configuration $i$ to $j$ ($i \to j$) is defined as:

$$
m_{i \to j} = \frac{|FP_j - FP_i|}{Z_j - Z_i},
$$

where:  
- $FP_k$ = forgone payment at zoning level $k$  
- $Z_k$ = number of zones at level $k$  

The metric $m_{i \to j}$ represents the change in forgone payments **per additional zone** (ZMW per zone). The absolute value ensures a non-negative measure, though it may be omitted if a signed change is preferred.


## Results 

### Payout Balance Index (PBI) and Forgone Payments Analysis

| **Zoning Method**             | **$PBI_{\text{avg}}$** | **Forgone Payments (in millions of Zambian Kwacha) ** | **Notes**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Provinces (n = 10)             | 80.30%                 | 7.89                     | Zambia’s first administrative level.                                      |
| Optimized K-Means (n = 29)     | 84.39%                 | 6.25                     | Zones generated by K-means clustering, with the number of clusters chosen using the Davies–Bouldin Index. |

### Total Benefit per Zone Change 

The table below reports the total benefit associated with increasing the number of zones at each stage of aggregation. Specifically, it shows the gains from:  

- Expanding from 10 provinces to 29 clusters  
- Expanding from 29 clusters to 115 districts  
- Expanding from 115 districts to 2,474 camps  

| **Zoning Method**       | Total Benefit (in millions of Zambian Kwacha) |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Provinces → Clusters     |  1.64                                         |
| Clusters → Districts     |  1.93                                         |
| Districts → Camps        |  2.32                                         |

### Marginal Benefit per Zone Change

The table below shows the marginal benefit of increasing the number of zones, calculated by dividing the change in total benefit by the difference in the number of zones between levels.  

| **Zoning Transition**   | Marginal Benefit (Zambian Kwacha per zone) |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Provinces → Clusters     | 86,205.06                                  |
| Clusters → Districts     | 22,420.11                                  |
| Districts → Camps        |    983.99                                  |
