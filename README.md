# Zambia Weather Index Insurance Optimization

The goal of this project is to reduce basis risk in weather index insurance contracts, building upon [earlier work](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/zambia-drought-analysis) where we introduced the Payout Balance Index (PBI). In this analysis, we extend that approach by applying **K-means clustering** to rainfall data, calculating the PBI at Zambia’s two administrative levels (provinces and districts), and incorporating camp-level zones created by *(add name)*. We also estimate the monetary value of **forgone insurance payouts** resulting from mismatches between payouts and observed rainfall conditions.

The forgone payout is calculated as:

$$
\text{Forgone Payout} =
(\text{Payout Value}) \times (1 - \text{PBI}) \times (\text{Number of Pixels Per Zone})
$$

---

### Marginal Benefit per Zone Change

After computing forgone payments, we evaluate the **marginal benefit** of increasing the number of zones. Specifically, the marginal effect of moving from zone configuration $i$ to $j$ ($i \to j$) is defined as:

$$
m_{i \to j} = \frac{|FP_j - FP_i|}{Z_j - Z_i},
$$

where:  
- $FP_k$ = forgone payment at zoning level $k$  
- $Z_k$ = number of zones at level $k$  

The metric $m_{i \to j}$ represents the change in forgone payments **per additional zone** (ZMW per zone). The absolute value ensures a non-negative measure, though it may be omitted if a signed change is preferred.

| Provinces (n = 10)             | 80.30%                 | Zambia’s first administrative level.                                      |
| Optimized K-Means (n = 29)     | 84.39%                 | Zones generated by K-means clustering, with the number of clusters chosen using the Davies–Bouldin Index. |
| Districts (Admin 2)            | 89.21%                 | Zambia’s second administrative level.                                     |
| Camps                          | 95.01%                 | Smallest administrative unit; zones correspond to farmer camps (name of data source to be added). |
