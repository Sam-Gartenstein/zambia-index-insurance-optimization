# Zambia Weather Index Insurance Optimization

The goal of this project is to reduce basis risk in weather insurance contracts, building upon [earlier work](https://github.com/Sam-Gartenstein/zambia-drought-analysis) where we introduced the Payout Balance Index (PBI). In addition to K-means clustering, we calculate the PBI using Zambiaâ€™s two administrative levels along with camps developed by (name), and estimate the monetary value of insurance forgone due to mismatches between payouts and actual conditions. This is calculated by 

$$
\text{Forgone Payout} =
(\text{Payout Value}) \times (1 - \text{PBI}) \times (\text{Number of Pixels Per Zone})
$$  


After calculating the forgone payments, we calculate the marginal benefit per zone change (going from lower to higher zone numbers). That is, the marginal effect of moving from zone $i$ to zone $j$ ($i \to j$) is defined as:

$$
m_{i \to j} = \frac{\lvert FP_j - FP_i \rvert}{Z_j - Z_i},
$$

where $FP_k$ is the forgone payment at level $k$ and $Z_k$ is the number of zones at that level. The quantity $m_{i \to j}$ measures the absolute change in forgone payments per additional zone (ZMW per zone). Remove the absolute value if a signed measure is preferred.
